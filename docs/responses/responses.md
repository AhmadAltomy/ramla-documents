Salam @Ahmed Altomy I have a question. I’m going to send some alternate images for the categories using illustrations so we can see if it looks better with those. What size do you recommend for the images because there the square category menu option and the longer rectangular one. I can make two sizes. No rush, just let me know when you have a minute, thank you!

### Answer 1 - From Ahmed Altomy

Hala Noor, I hope you're doing great!

When it comes to mobile devices, two common aspect ratios are 16:9 and 4:3. These ratios work really well on phones and tablets.

For the standard 16:9 aspect ratio, it's best to use an image resolution of 1920 × 1080 pixels. This resolution works smoothly on various screen densities for both Android (mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi) and iOS (1x, 2x, 3x).

This size is a good fit for both square and longer rectangular menu options.

Thank you so much for your help. I really appreciate it. Have a great day!

Salama Ahmad, for the 16:9 is it a landscape or vertical? And what pixel size is good for the 4:3 aspect

### Answer 2 - From Ahmed Altomy

The 16:9 is a landscape, is better to use a landscape image for the 16:9 aspect ratio.

For the 4:3 aspect ratio, I recommend using an image resolution of 1024 × 768 pixels.


And also for the onboarding screens, 
I've added just a placeholder images; when you free maybe you can create some illustrations for them; please, 
I left them for you to check what you can do with them.

Noor, I'm sorry to bother you.

Can you take a look at the pictures and tell me what you think? Is the width okay, or should I change something?

Also, could you check Images 1 and 2 in the app? I added a dark layer to them. Do you prefer Images 3 and 4 without the dark layer?

Lastly, I want to say thank you for these amazing images. I really love them.
