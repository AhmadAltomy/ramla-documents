# (RMS) Analysis

A request management system (RMS) is a system that allows users to submit requests to a team. The team can then manage
the requests, and respond to them.

## Primary features of an RMS

### Request submission

- **Input channels**: Users can submit requests through a variety of channels, such as email, web forms, or mobile
  applications.

  different information.
- **Request types**: Users can submit different types of requests, which can be customized to collect different
  information.
- **Request templates**: Users can submit requests based on templates, which can be customized to collect different
  information.
- **Request attachments**: Users can submit requests with attachments, such as images or documents.
- **Request metadata**: Users can submit requests with metadata, such as location or time.
- **Request validation**: Users can submit requests that are validated, such as by checking that required fields are
  filled out.
- **Request preview**: Users can preview their requests before submitting them.
- **Request confirmation**: Users can receive a confirmation that their request was submitted.
- **Request status**: Users can see the status of their requests, such as whether they are pending, in progress, or
  completed.
- **Request history**: Users can see the history of their requests, such as when they were submitted, when they were
  updated, and when they were completed.
- **Request cancellation**: Users can cancel their requests.
- **Request deletion**: Users can delete their requests.
- **Request expiration**: Users can submit requests that expire after a certain amount of time.
- **Request submission limits**: Users can submit a limited number of requests, such as a maximum number of requests per
  day.

### Request tracking

- **Unique request identifiers**: Requests have unique identifiers, such as a number or a code.
- **Status updates**: Users can receive status updates about their requests, such as when they are pending, in progress,
  or completed.
- **Status notifications**: Users can receive notifications about their requests, such as when they are pending, in
  progress, or completed.

### Priority and assignment

- **Request priority**: Requests have a priority, such as low, medium, or high.
- **Request assignment**: Requests can be assigned to a team member.

### Notifications and reminders

- **Request notifications**: Users can receive notifications about their requests, such as when they are pending, in
  progress, or completed.
- **Request reminders**: Users can receive reminders about their requests, such as when they are pending, in progress,
  or completed.
- **Request escalation**: Users can receive notifications when their requests are escalated, such as when they are
  pending for too long.

### Approval workflows

- **Request approval**: Requests can be approved by a team member.
- **Request approval workflows**: Requests can be approved by multiple team members, in a specific order.
- **Request approval notifications**: Users can receive notifications when their requests are approved.

### Reporting and analytics

- **Request reporting**: Users can generate reports about their requests, such as how many requests were submitted, how
  many requests were completed, and how many requests are pending.
- **Request analytics**: Users can generate analytics about their requests, such as how many requests were submitted,
  how many requests were completed, and how many requests are pending.
- **Request dashboards**: Users can see dashboards about their requests, such as how many requests were submitted, how
  many requests were completed, and how many requests are pending.
- **Request metrics**: Users can see metrics about their requests, such as how many requests were submitted, how many
  requests were completed, and how many requests are pending.
- **Request charts**: Users can see charts about their requests, such as how many requests were submitted, how many
  requests were completed, and how many requests are pending.

## Benefits of an RMS

- **Centralized request management**: Requests are managed in a centralized location, such as a single system.
- **Efficient request management**: Requests are managed efficiently, such as by automating repetitive tasks.
- **Reduced errors**: Errors are reduced, such as by automating repetitive tasks.
- **Data-driven decision-making**: Decisions are made based on data, such as by generating reports and analytics.
- **Improved communication**: Communication is improved, such as by sending notifications and reminders.
- **Improved collaboration**: Collaboration is improved, such as by assigning requests to team members.
